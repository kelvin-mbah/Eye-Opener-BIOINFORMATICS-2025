#  My Bioinformatics Journey: From "What's FASTQ?" to Pipeline Analysis

##  The Real Story Behind This Repository

This isn't a perfect tutorial written by an expert. This is my _authentic learning journey_ - complete with confusion, surprises, and breakthrough moments. I believe documenting the struggle is as important as documenting the success.

## The Night Everything Changed

### The Beginning: Manual Analysis Hell
I started where every bioinformatician starts - manually running tools one by one, not understanding how they connected.

*What I felt*: "This is very stressful! There has to be a better and easier way!"

### The Discovery: Nextflow Magic
I went from analyzing *1 sample in 2 hours* to *5 samples in 41 minutes* with one command:

```bash
# Before: 10+ lines of manual commands
fastq-dump → fastqc → bwa → samtools → freebayes → (repeat for 5 samples...)

# After: One magical line
nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon --input samplesheet.csv

**## The Resource Management Lesson**
# What the training manual said (for servers):
--max_memory '12.GB' --max_cpus 8

# What my laptop could handle:
--max_memory '2.GB' --max_cpus 2

**##Why This Repository Exists**
This is not to show that i am an expert. it is to show that :
I can go from not knowing something to figuring out through curiousity, persistence, and documentation.
